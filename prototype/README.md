# Our Amazing Prototype

This consists of a node.js backend, and an angular frontend.  
Functionality is a simple search bar that will send your food query to the calorie-ninjas api, then display the nutritional facts returned.

## How to run

To launch the frontend server, `cd` into `frontend` and run `ng serve`.  
  
To run backend server, `cd` into `backend/bin/` and run `node www`.  
  
For the prototype to work correctly, you must allow CORS. We're using the Allow CORS extension in Chrome to do this.
