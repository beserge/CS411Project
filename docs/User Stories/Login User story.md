# Login User story

Registered users press the login button on the main splashscreen, which takes them to a login page. The user enters their email address and then their account password.  
Then they will press the login button. If the email and password match a valid account, they will be taken to the site dashboard.  
If the email and password do not match a valid account, some text will appear saying “Either your email address is invalid, or your password is incorrect.”  
Then the users will try logging in again. After the first invalid login attempt, the user can choose to set up a new account.
