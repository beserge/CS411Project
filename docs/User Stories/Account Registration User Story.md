# Account Registration User Story

When the user decides to make an account, they press the signup button on the splash page, and are taken to the signup page.  
  
The user will enter their email. If the email entered does not match standard email formatting, text pops up saying so.  
The user enters their desired password twice. If the passwords do not match, text pops up next to the second one saying so.  
The user enters their desired username. If the username matches one already in the database, text pops up saying so. The user then submits their account details.  
If there are any error conditions present, text pops up at the top saying “Fix any errors before continuing”, and the user cannot continue.  
If the user submits the form without all required fields being filled, a message will appear at the top saying “Please fill out all required fields”, and the user cannot continue.  
If the form has been filled out correctly, the user will be taken to the BMI page after pressing submit. 
  
The user will enter their height, weight, and gender.  
If the user tries to submit without entering any one of these the page says “please enter (MISSED THING) before continuing”, and the user will not continue.  
If the user wants to go back a page, they can do so as well. If they have filled out the form correctly, the user can move on to the goals page.  
If they want to go back a page, they may do this as well.  
   
The user will enter their total weight loss / gain goal in pounds or kilograms. The user will have a weight loss / gain goal suggested to them based on their BMI data.  
The user will enter their time frame for losing / gaining this weight. The system will suggest a reasonable time frame based on the amount of weight to lose.  
The user will not be able to enter a goal that would put them into an unhealthy BMI, or would ask them to lose / gain weight too quickly.  
This will be based on W.H.O. data. When the user enters their goals, the system will tell them how much weight they have to gain / lose per week.  
The user can tweak their goals until they reach a pace that they feel is reasonable. The user will then move on to the diet preferences page.
