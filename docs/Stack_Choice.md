# Technology Stack Comparison

For our application, in the planning phase of selecting the stack, we found out that both the MEAN stack and Django can be our technology stack choice.  
Django and the MEAN stack are both popular and Django couldâ€™ve been used with Python, which we were already familiar with.  
However, we chose to use the MEAN stack, because it is designed for Node.js, which we decided we would like to use as the cross platform, back-end runtime environment.  
We also used the WebStorm lecture video to guide us. This made it easy to get going with Angular and Node.  
Moreover, JavaScript is not the hardest language to write and its flexibility makes communication between the front and back end easier.  
One of our goals as a team was to learn a new technology. Javascript was newer to us as a team than Python, so the MEAN stack provided a learning opportunity.  
Javascript runs natively on the web, and Django ends up being transpiled to Javascript anyways, so writing code that can run natively on the web is a plus for the MEAN stack.
